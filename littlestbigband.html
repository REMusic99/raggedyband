          	We also provide discounts in the following three situations when a community can: (1) book multiple shows through the year, (2) book two or more shows in different areas of the same community on the same day, and (3) book a morning or evening time so we can schedule more performances in a day. That last one is especially helpful in defraying our room and board costs when traveling.

    	<img src="images/lbb-route66sign.png" width="100" style="float:right; margin-left:20px" alt="route 66 sign">
      This show focuses on Route 66, from its beginning as a collection of military trails of the 1850s, to its official designation in 1926, to its decommissioning in 1985. A lot of things happened during those years and a lot of songs were sung. It's a story that touches almost everyone.

		<br class="br"><br>   
      	<span class="graphhead">Dean, Doris, and Frank</span>
      	<br>
       Beloved songs were often sung by beloved singers, and it's hard to find a more accomplished threesome than Doris Day, Dean Martin, and Frank Sinatra. Altogether, these singers recorded more than 2,000 songs. Get a sense of the times and places each singer lived and worked in as you sing along with unforgettable tunes like "That's Amore," "Sentimental Journey," and "High Hopes."

      	<span class="graphhead">
	    	Sock Hop/50's Jukebox
	    </span>
	    <br>
	    As our audiences get younger, tastes in music change, and so we are adapting our music to include more of the 1950s and 1960s, and even some 1970s and '80s. The 1950s and 60s era of the sock hop is especially popular, so this set features more Elvis and Everly Brothers, with still a few visits from the ever popular Sinatra, Dino, and Hank Sr.

      Songs often help tell the stories in movies, and many of the standards, with their rich lyrics and timeless melodies, continue to be used to do that. Tunes like "As Time Goes By" become part of the memory of <a href="https://amzn.to/2GLdVHf" target="1"><i>Casablanca</i></a>, while movies like <a href="https://amzn.to/2EeJebT" target="1">Space Cowboys</a> benefit from the timelessness of "Fly Me to the Moon."
		<br class="br"><br>   
 
      	<span class="graphhead">Traveling Tunes</span>
      	<br>
      Places and how to get to them are the meat of this show, from walking to bicycling to cars, trains, planes, and boats, the cities and countries and even planets.
      <br class="br"><br>   
      	<span class="graphhead">The Splendor of Love</span>
      <br>
      Most songs are about some aspect of love, so it's an easy matter to develop a setlist of love songs for Valentine's Day, Mother's and Father's Day, Grandparent's Day...you get the idea. Lynn and Bob like to feature them the whole month of February.
            <br class="br"><br>   
      	<span class="graphhead">By the Numbers (or the Letters)</span>
      	<br>
      Going through the songs by date or by the alphabet is an interesting way to show off the tunes and the decades they were written and performed.
             <br class="br"><br>
             <span class="graphhead">Christmas Classics</span>
